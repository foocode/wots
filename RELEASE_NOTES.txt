WOTS Desktop v0.1.0 Beta
========================
Initial creation of release notes!

NOTE: NO CROWDSOURCING FEATURES ACTIVE. Your notebook entries are not being shared (even if the options say so).
                                                                                    
What's New:
- Well, everything! Of note:
-- Full single user experience in place - your notebook is fully functional
-- Driver tagging with many tags across 4 categories
-- International character support for driver names when iRacing provides them
-- Release notes on Home screen
-- Team support
-- Local API exposing My Notebook entries for use in overlays and beyond

Still To Come:
- Backend syncing & crowdsourcing still under testing
